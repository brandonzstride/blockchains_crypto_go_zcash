## Problem Statement
We want to benchmark the Zcash cryptocurrency in a standardized way using the Diablo benchmarking application. Diablo has already been used to test Ethereum, Solana, Diem, Quorum, Algorand, and Avalanche. Our goal is to add Zcash to this list.

## Go Zcash
Diablo runs in Go. All of the previously-tested blockchains have a Go implementation or have Go SDKs (e.g. Solana is in Rust). Zcash is written in C++ and C. We need to call Zcash functions from Go.
1. **hello world files**; We began with some ``hello world'' files.
    ```c++
    /* hello.cpp */
    #include <iostream>

    int main() {
        std::cout << "Hello, world in C++!" << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }
    ```

    Run it:
    ```console
    > g++ hello.cpp -o hello
    > ./hello
    Hello, world in C++!
    ```

    And in Go:
    ```go
    /* hello.go */
    package main

    import "fmt"

    func main() {
        fmt.Println("Hello, world in Go!")
    }
    ```

    Run it:
    ```console
    > go run hello.go
    Hello, world in Go!
    ```

    Both of these files run quite easily, but now we want to run `hello.c` from a Go file. According to swig.org, "Go does not support direct calling of functions written in C/C++. The cgo program may be used to generate wrappers to call C code from Go, but there is no convenient way to call C++ code. SWIG fills this gap".

2. **SWIG minimal example**; Fill in details here on running SWIG with ``hello world'' files.
